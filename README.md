Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Case Study
📝 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow — from loading raw data to presenting insights. It includes Python-based data processing, SQL analysis, Power BI visualization, and a final presentation created using Gamma.
The goal is to showcase strong analytical thinking, clean coding practices, database querying skills, and storytelling through dashboards.

📁 Dataset

The dataset (CSV/Excel) is loaded and analyzed in Python.

It includes fields such as customer details, transactions, orders, sales metrics, etc.

Size: XX rows × XX columns (replace with actual values).

You can place the dataset inside the data/ folder.

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server)

Power BI Desktop

Gamma App for presentation

Git / GitHub for version control

🔍 Steps Performed
1️⃣ Data Loading
